My python code

#A function that calculates the area of a square
def circleArea(radius):
	area = 3.142 * (radius ** 2)
	return (area)

radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the circle in centimeters: "))
print(f"The area of the circle of radius {radius} is {squareArea(radius)} centimeters square.")
